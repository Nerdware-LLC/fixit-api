## Getting Started

This project uses [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), so all changes happen through pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Submit that pull request!

## Commit Messages

Contributions to this project must use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages, as they are an integral part of this project's CI/CD automation. Commit messages are parsed by [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#readme), integrated into the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md), and included in the [release](#release-process) notes.

## Release Process

This project uses [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#readme) to automate the following components of the release process:

- [GitHub releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) are automatically created based on the commit history since the last release.
- The [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) is updated automatically based on the commit history since the last release.
- Git tags and the `"version"` specified in the [package.json](./package.json) are automatically updated based on the commit history since the last release.

> **_Do not touch (please):_ ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆðŸš«** <!-- No touchie!ðŸ¦™ -->
>
> - The [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)
> - The `"version"` field in [package.json](./package.json)
> - Git tags

> The robot minions work hard to manage these - **_please don't upset them_** ðŸ¤–

Once tests are passing on your pull request, and it has been approved by a maintainer, it will be merged into the `next` branch, which will trigger a versioned pre-release. After final review and approval of the pre-release build, a maintainer will merge `next` into `main`, which will trigger a release build.
