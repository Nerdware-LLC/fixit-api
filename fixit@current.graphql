  with or fuzzy-matches a provided string, use `searchForUsersByHandle`.

  """
  This query returns a paginated list of Users whose handle begins with the provided
  `handle` argument, which can be incomplete but must at least contain two characters:
  the beginning "@", and one character that's either alphanumeric or an underscore.
  
  Note that this query is intended to be used in conjunction with a pagination utility
  like [Apollo's `fetchMore` function](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/pagination/core-api#the-fetchmore-function).
  
  ### ROADMAP:
  
  - Matching Algorithm Change: In the future, the Contact selection method used in this
    query will either be replaced by a fuzzy-matching system based on the Levenshtein-Demerau
    model, or a cloud-based search service like ElasticSearch. This change will eliminate
    the `offset` restrictions in regard to the value of `handle` in follow-up queries.
  - Response Structure: The response may be converted into an object with keys `data` and
    `nextOffset`. The `data` key will contain the array of matching Users, and `nextOffset`
    will be the value of the `offset` argument to be used in a follow-up query.

      1. A previous call to this query returned the maximum number of results (i.e., `limit`).
      2. The User who made the previous call wants to retrieve more results.
      3. The `handle` argument in the previous call is a valid substring of the `handle`
         argument in the subsequent call (e.g., "@foo" followed by "@fooz"). While not enforced,
         querying "@fooz" followed by "@foo" with an offset may result in matchable users being
         excluded from the results.
