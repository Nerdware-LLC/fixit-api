# Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability:

Any effort to discover and disclose security vulnerabilities in a responsible manner is deeply appreciated. Instead of opening a GitHub Issue for security vulnerabilities, please email [trevor@nerdware.cloud](mailto:trevor@nerdware.cloud) with the bug report.

_**Help me help you -**_ please include any of the following:

- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Any relevant tools, including versions used
- Tool output

Thank you!
