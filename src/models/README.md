# Models

This directory contains the application's `models`, which are created using [`@nerdware/ddb-single-table`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nerdware/ddb-single-table).

### Model Design Goals

Each `model` is designed to achieve the following design goals:

- Define the shape of database objects.
- Encapsulate database CRUD operations.
- Handle all database I/O validation and transformation.
